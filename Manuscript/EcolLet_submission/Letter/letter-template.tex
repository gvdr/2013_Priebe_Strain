\opening{Dear Prof. Coulson:}

We are happy to inform you of our decision to submit our manuscript titled
\mytitle for publication as a Letter in \myjournal.

We believe that our manuscript will be of strong interest to the readership of
\myjournal as it elucidates a novel connection between the species' functional
diversity, ecological centrality and evolutionary distinctiveness in a complex
ecosystem. Therefore, we believe that the methods we introduce and the results
we obtain in the manuscript are relevant for the researchers in the three disciplines.

Faced with increasing environmental threats, such as climate change, that
permeate across entire ecosystems, we can hardly overestimate the importance of
understanding how different species contribute to a food web stability
(importance), functioning (centrality) and diversity (uniqueness). However,
identifying phenotypic traits with a functional role across a whole food web is
ambitious and collecting enough data is laborious; moreover, the available
graph theoretical measures were defined on rigid, deterministic graph models
and thus the insights they provide may be limited. Additionally, we miss an
integrated framework in which to combine the manifold components of species'
ecological relevance.

In our manuscript we define and measure at once the species' importance,
centrality and uniqueness in the Serengeti National Park food web under a fully
stochastic complex network model. Estimating the species' foraging and
vulnerability abstract functional traits directly from the interaction data, we
provide a bridge between the network and the functional-traits analysis of food
webs.  The results we obtain---and validate on five large food webs---highlight
the necessity of explicitly considering both the evolutionary and ecological
originality of species for the purpose of conservation prioritization and
planning.
