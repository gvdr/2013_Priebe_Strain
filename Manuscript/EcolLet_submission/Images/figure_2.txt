Both the species' strain and their mean distance show a strong phylogenetic signal and they are significantly correlated. a) Phylogenetic analysis of the species' strain and the species' mean distance in the functional space (species as predators, ``in'', as prey, ``out'', and  as both predators and prey, ``all'') for the Serengeti National Park food web \cite{Baskerville2011} (the phylogeny was compiled by deZwaan \emph{et al.}, see supplementary material).  In particular, the data consistently supports an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of evolution \cite{OUXXX}.
b) ﻿Distribution of strain (left) and their mean distance (right) in the the functional space of species (as both predators and prey) among the tips of Serengeti National Park phylogeny \cite{baskerville2011,dallariva2015oikos}. We focus on a model dimensionality equal to three, as discussed in \cite{dallariva2015oikos}. The lighter, yellow, colours correspond to lowe values, the darker blue colours to higher values. The silhouette (from phylopic.com \cite{phylopic}, see Supplementary Material for more details) mark the rough position of some taxonomic unit (species or clades). In particular, the hyrax correspond to the species with highest strain and mean distance. The strain of plants is generally lower than that of the Animalia and there's a significant correlation between the two measures, see \ref{resXXX}.
c) There's a significant linear correlation, corrected for the phylogenetic covariance, between mean distance and strain computed in the functional space of species as prey and as both predators and prey; the signal is not consistently significant for the functional space of species as predators, starting from a model dimension of four (it is still significant at the optimal model dimension of $d = 3$ \cite{dallariva2015oikos}).
d) There's a significant correlation between the species' strain, their mean distance in the functional space and the species' contribution to the community Functional Diversity, measured as the difference between the volume of the species' convex hull in the functional space with or without a species. However, measuring a species convex hull is a computationally intensive task, and it is not affordable for more than four (species as both predators and prey) and eight (species as predators or prey) coordinates. The species' strain is a good indicator of a species contribution to the food-web Functional Diversity.
