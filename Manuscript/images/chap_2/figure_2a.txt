Both the species' strain and their mean distance show a strong phylogenetic signal and they are significantly correlated. a) Phylogenetic analysis of the species' strain and the species' mean distance in the functional space (species as predators, ``in'', as prey, ``out'', and  as both predators and prey, ``all'') for the Serengeti National Park food web \cite{Baskerville2011} (the phylogeny was compiled by deZwaan \emph{et al.}, see supplementary material).  In particular, the data consistently supports an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of evolution \cite{OUXXX}. b) There's a significant linear correlation, corrected for the phylogenetic covariance, between mean distance and strain computed in the functional space of species as prey and as both predators and prey; the signal is not consistently significant for the functional space of species as predators, starting from a model dimension of four while it is significant at the optimal model dimension of $d = 3$, suggested in \cite{dallariva2015oikos}.
