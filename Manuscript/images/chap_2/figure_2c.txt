There's a significant correlation between the species' strain, their mean distance in the functional space and the species' contribution to the community Functional Diversity, measured as the difference between the volume of the species' convex hull in the functional space with or without a species. However, measuring a species convex hull is a computationally intensive task, and it is not affordable for more than four (species as both predators and prey) and eight (species as predators or prey) coordinates. The species' strain is a good indicator of a species contribution to the food-web Functional Diversity.
