The importance of a species in a food web has been assesed by ecologists 
in a variety of way which span most of the
centrality measures based on network structure \cite{estrada2007characterization,martin2010centrality,
harary1959status,freeman1977set,freeman1979centrality,bonacich1987power,brin1998anatomy}.
All these measures, however, rely on a rigidly deterministic approach to food
webs, albeit the increasing evidence that ecological networks are inherently
stocastic \cite{Poisotetal,XXX}.

\paragraph{Random Dot Product Graph}

A natural framework for network partitioning is the stochastic blockmodel graph
theory, originally developed for undirected social network analysis
\cite{holland1983stochastic} and subsequently generalised to directed graphs
\cite{wang1987stochastic}.  Under this model, each of the $n$ species of a food
web are assigned to one of $K$ blocks whose within and between linking
probability are given by the model parameters. We do not observe the assignment
of the species; rather, we observe the realized adjacency matrix. It has been
proved that a consistent block estimator based on the spectral partitioning of
the normalized Laplacian of the adjacency matrix exist \cite{rohe2011spectral},
that is the proportion of nodes assigned to the wrong group by the estimator
converge in probability to zero as the size of the graph grows to infinity. We
will present the definitions in the context of \textit{Random Dot Product}
graphs \cite{fishkind2013consistent}, which can be seen as a particular example
of stochastic blockmodels.

We will consider the generalization of the latter result to the spectral
partitioning of adjacency matrices \cite{sussman2012consistent}. Here we
propose a measure, called the {\em embedding strain}, which express the
difference between the original food web and the food web derived by the loss,
or non-observation, of one of the species. The method doesn't require the
knowledge of the number of the blocks but just an upper bound on the rank of
the communication probability matrix. The computation of the embedding
strain of each node via simple brute force is feasible for food webs of
usual size.

In summary, the proposed method consists in computing the estimated parameter
matrix for the original observed adjacency matrix, as shown in
\cite{fishkind2013consistent}, removing the species $i$ from the graph
embedding and computing the distance of the reduced matrix to the estimated
parameter matrix for the modified adjacency matrix obtained by removing from
the original food web the species $i$.

We will apply it to two compilations of the Serengeti food web, namely
\cite{baskerville2011spatial} and \cite{de2011serengeti}, the Caribbean marine
food web in its original compilation \cite{rezende2009compartments} and to the
food web we derived from the latter clustering the species in their families.

Finally we will discuss a possible interpretation of the results in terms of
species loss, wherein the strain represents how much a food web change its
geometry after the lost species extinction, and in terms of non observation of
a one species due to possible sampling error during the food web compilation
(see \cite[Section 11.2]{rossberg2013food}), wherein the strain represents
how much a statistical description of the food web may be different.
