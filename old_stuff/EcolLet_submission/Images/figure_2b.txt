Distribution of strain (left) and their mean distance (right) in the the functional space of species (as both predators and prey) among the tips of Serengeti National Park phylogeny \cite{baskerville2011,dallariva2015oikos}. We focus on a model dimensionality equal to three, as discussed in \cite{dallariva2015oikos}. The lighter, yellow, colours correspond to lowe values, the darker blue colours to higher values. The silhouette (from phylopic.com \cite{phylopic}, see Supplementary Material for more details) mark the rough position of some taxonomic unit (species or clades). In particular, the hyrax correspond to the species with highest strain and mean distance. The strain of plants is generally lower than that of the Animalia and there's a significant correlation between the two measures, see \ref{resXXX}.
