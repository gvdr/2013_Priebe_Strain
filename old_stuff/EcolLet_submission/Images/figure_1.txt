The distribution of species' strain for the Serengeti National Park \cite{Baskerville2011} is non normal and the ranking it induces among species is robust with respect to the choice of model dimension $d$. a) Log transformed strains computed on the full functional space (species as both predators and prey). We computed the strains in dimension from 1 to 15. b) In \cite{dallariva2015oikos} we identified a suitable model dimension around $d = 3$. We present the distribution of the log transformed strain at that dimension. c) Correlation between the ranking of Species according to their strain across ranks; all correlations are significant.
