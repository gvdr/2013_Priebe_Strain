The species' strain and their mean distance in the functional space (either a predators, ``in'', prey, ``out'', or as both predators and prey, ``all'') is in general correlated with the common network indexes associated with keystone species, namely betwenness, ``BC'', closeness, ``CC'', degree, ``DC'', Eigenvector, ``EC'', information, ``IC'', and sub-graph, ``SC'', centralities. The strength and significance of the correlations vary according to the centrality index---it is not consistenly significant for EC and IC--, the portion of the functional space examined---the species' strain and their mean distance as prey is less strongly correlated with the keystone centralities--- and the model dimensionality---the correlation is more significant for the low dimensional models.
